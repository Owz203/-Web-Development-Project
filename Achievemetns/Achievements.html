            Before University I studied chemistry, mathematics, and computer science as well as Welsh
            back.
            I really enjoyed studying all these subjects as they posed a challenge. They were also really interesting to
            get involved with. I am now attending University and studying cybersecurity. So far, I have done
            fundamentals of computing and cybersecurity and code lab. Iâ€™m now studying web development, digital
            forensics, and Computer industry.
            My favorite achievement is my Utility App that I made for code lab.
