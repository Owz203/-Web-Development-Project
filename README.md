# -Web-Development-Project 

Brief


Your task is to build an interactive website using web technologies. Your project should make use of the range of techniques you have explored during the module and demonstrate your understanding of these techniques and ability to deploy them successfully. For this assessment you have to decide a theme on which you will create your website.

Theme 1 – Portfolio
In this theme, you can create your own personal portfolio website that showcases your work, experience and overall development, something that you can use professionally in future.

Theme 2 – Business
In this theme, you can select any business (real or fictional) and create a promotional website that showcases what the business offers.

Theme 3 – Favourite Media
In this theme, you can create a website that showcases your favourite game, film or book series, or musical artist.

Theme 4 – Creative Experience
In this theme, you can create a website that includes a creative experience as its focus. This experience should be developed using the Canvas API or other similar javascript library (e.g. p5.js). You could make a simple game*, an arts experience or an interactive landscape. This is a deliberately loose theme and we welcome creative interpretations. 

*The game must be original and not a recreation of games such as tic-tac-toe, rock paper scissors, snake or flappy bird

This theme must include a landing page, a page that holds the experience and an about /instructions page. You can add further relevant pages if you wish.

Constraints


For the above themes there are some creative/technical constraints to consider:

The piece must deploy HTML5 and CSS.
The website must include at least 3 pages in which the user must be able to make navigational decisions (e.g. pick where they want to go next).
Your website should include media assets (i.e. still images, moving
images, (audio or video if possible)) to make your website more interactive and engaging.
Javascript and related languages/technologies may be used to enhance your website.
Deliverables


The deliverables for the Web Development Project are as follows:



Web Development Project

Project Files: This includes your HTML and CSS files, as well as any image, video and audio assets needed to render your project. These should be uploaded to your Web Dev GitHub Repository.



The Development Document 

Your Web Development Project must be accompanied by a Development Document of 1,000 - 2,000 words. 

Please include the following elements (note the suggested word counts):

Brief: A very short description of what you have been asked to develop (50 words).
Design Direction: What theme did you choose and why? What is the underlying concept of the piece? (300 words). 
Technical Description & Walkthrough:  In this section you should provide a link to a video which includes a walkthrough of your program running as well as a technical breakdown of your code. This technical breakdown should explain how the key features of your program have been implemented via code. The video technical description & walkthrough contributes to the overall word count. The anticipated length of the video is 3-5 minutes.
Critical Reflection: An evaluation of your project that notes what is compelling about the work, what could be improved, and what web programming techniques you need to learn to make such improvements (300 words).
