        <div id="Intro">
            <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Owain and welcome to my portfolio web page. I hope to give you an insight to who I am and what I've worked on, what I've been a part of and some background of me.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Birth">
            <p>I was Born in Abergavenny in Wales, but I moved around at a young age. I've visited Paris and Florida. I've lived in Cyprus for a while and then moved to Canada for the majority of my childhood. Due to some personal circumstances, we moved back the Wales. As I was raised in Canada, I was already two years behind my peers, so I had some catching up to do. I was held back a year for this reason. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Auto">
            <p>At the age of 7 I was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition which started in my right eye with uveitis (which is quite rare at my age) and in my right knee arthritis. My condition over the year developed and grew worse. My eye developed a cataract and Iâ€™ve had many operations in the one eye. My arthritis also spread at the time to my left knee. My left eye restricted my vision and so my left eye has grown to be stronger than the average eye. My left eye now has the strength to see just as good as two eyes (so not all bad news ðŸ˜Š) with this eye I have adapted and learned to live with restricted vision, simple things like how to look left and right before crossing were an issue for me at the time.  However, my condition was extremely volatile as one day I would be running and jumping and the next I would be bound to a wheelchair. Iâ€™ve grown up with theses condition for over a decade and my autoimmune condition has yet to be pinpointed by specialists.</p>
        </div>


        <div id="Gym">
            <p>Iâ€™m proud to say that Iâ€™ve never let my illness get the best of me. Iâ€™ve tried to be as positive as I can with life. As soon as my knees stopped being so unpredictable, I decide to take up the gym recently. I try and go as much as possible which I believe helps keep my body strong. Since starting I feel a lot better in myself and I can see myself progressing.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Covid">
            <p>When covid hit in 2020 due to my vulnerability I had too self-isolate earlier than most. But with my brother and my uncle (who in Canada) we decided to take up boxing. Iâ€™ve kept it up as much as I possibly can. We learnt a lot during that time such as self-discipline and perveance. I also did clay pigeon shooting before covid and due my right eye I had to learn left-handed, but my left eye was able to adapt and aid in my favour. That also taught me focus, adaptability and better reaction times. I also like to play games as itâ€™s a way for me to enjoy spending time with friends and family anywhere in the world. It also allowed me to keep in touch with friends during the pandemic and I would say has made those connections stronger. Playing games at first to most may seem like a waste of time but I do it because it makes me happy, and I do learn skills such as strategic planning and help with reaction speed and allows me to handle stressful situations a lot better. Before the pandemic I was in robotics club with was fun as I was able to build and program robots on a small scale which is one of the many things that got me into technology.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Interest">
            <p>What made me interested in Computers. I first got interested when my uncle introduced me to the world of computers with his line of work. Iâ€™ve been interested ever since. I also grew and expanded my interest as I loved to learn more about computers and what you can do with them. The possibilities almost feel endless. Although technology can feel frustrating sometimes, I love to problem  solve so a good challenge is always exciting and overcoming those challenges gives me a great satisfaction.</p>
